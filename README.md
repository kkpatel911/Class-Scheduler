# * MOC MEETUP *

Moc Meetup is a project for UTC students (University of Tennessee at Chattanooga) that scrapes the UTC course catalog and helps students find statistically viable meeting times for their clubs. The project code is hosted on heroku with a Free Dyno and free Postgres Database.

### How does it work?

On the first day of each UTC semester, the project wipes the database and scrapes the newest class schedule. Users can then specify classes in the site's main page to see the times those classes appear in heatmap form

### What is this useful for?

This project is made for two people groups:

1. Club organizers. If a club wants to make an event for Freshman or Sophomores, they will need to know the most statistically likely times for those students to be out of a class.
2. Tutors. When a tutor sets their available times, they do not know who will need their services, but if they tutor several classes, many studnets may be unable to make appointments due to class conflicts. Getting a visible heatmap of how some classes stack up on an hourly basis can help find times that everyone can make use of.

### Heroku?

Heroku is a cloud hosting site. They have free trials for students, and most users are allowed one low-traffic dyno for learning use. Heroku has a lot of great tutorials and is a fantastic resource for makers.

### Postgres?

Postgres is a part of the SQL language family, and uses relational data. Tables are defined by what they can hold and the database sorts the data for maxiumum space and speed efficiency. SQL is a tricky subject, but some professors are knowledgable enough in it to help. SSMS is the enterprise standard for graphical SQL interfaces, so if you want to go into database management, learning how to use SSMS would be a great first step.
